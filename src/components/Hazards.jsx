            <h2>Understanding Hurricane Risks</h2>
            <h4>Storm Surge</h4>
            <p>Storm surge happens when ocean waters rise due to strong winds and low pressure. This can quickly flood coastal areas, sometimes with multiple feet of waterâ€”often ranging from 3 to 12 feet or more causing serious damage to homes and buildings. The strong water movement can also create dangerous currents, making it hard for people to evacuate and increasing the risk of losing lives.</p>
            <h4>Flooding</h4>
            <p>Heavy rainfall during a hurricane can overload drainage systems, leading to urban flooding. Storm surge can make this worse by flooding coastal areas at the same time. Overflow from already full rivers can also increase flooding in nearby communities, putting lives at risk in all these situations.</p>
            <h4>Tornadoes</h4>
            <p>Mesovortices are small, intense rotating areas within a hurricane&apos;s eyewall and outer bands. They can generate rotation that leads to tornadic activity, causing severe local damage, destroying homes, uprooting trees, and posing a serious threat to life and safety.</p>
            <h4>Strong Winds</h4>
            <p>Hurricanes are characterized by extremely strong winds measured on the Saffir-Simpson scale. These winds can reach destructive speeds, posing significant risks to life and property. Power outages are common, leaving communities without essential services for extended periods.</p>
            <h4>Landslides from Floods</h4>
            <p>Landslides from floods can occur in areas without mountainous or steep terrain when excessive rainfall leads to flooding. These landslides are difficult to predict and can pose life-threatening hazards to those in their path.</p>
